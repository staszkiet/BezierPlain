# 3rd-Degree Bezier Surface Triangular Mesh Renderer  
This project renders a 3rd-degree Bezier surface by interpolating it as a triangular mesh.
Users can manipulate surface orientation, lighting, and surface type.

## Initialization:

The Bezier surface is loaded from a 16-line text file, where each line provides a control point in 3D (x, y, z) as:  

X00 Y00 Z00  
X01 Y01 Z01  
...  
X33 Y33 Z33  
Where X0i is the first row of control points for Bezier's plain

## Triangular Mesh Generation and Rotation

The surface is generated by traingle-interpolation.
Users can rotate each mesh around the z-axis and x-axis by user-specified angles (α: -45° to 45°; β: 0° to 10°).
One can choose interpolation's accuracy (via slider) and whether the traingle-grid is visible or not.

## Lighting and Shading Model:

Program implements Lambertian shading with optional specular reflection. All the parameters can by adjusted via sliders.

## Object Color and Texture Mapping:

Program supports two object color modes:
Solid color chosen from a menu.
Texture-mapped surface, where a texture image is loaded by user
Optionally user can modify surface by providing a normal map.
## Animated Light Source:

Light source follows a elliptic path on a fixed z-plane which can be stopped and resumed
